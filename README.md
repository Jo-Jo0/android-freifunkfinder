Discussion Points  
Functional Requirements as understood by us:
1)	Application shall calculate GPS location of the user. 
2)	Application shall fetch on runtime latest json with list of available freifunkt wifi nodes. 
3)	Application shall efficiently calculate list of relevant wifi nodes. ( Range shall be user configurable or static? ) 
4)	Application shall have a “Start augmented wifi finder” button on click of which user’s back camera is started.
5)	Application intelligently senses the direction of camera and displays the available wifi nodes.
6)	On click of each wifi node, details regarding to that node are displayed( on camera or off camera?) 

Doubts:-
1)	There is only longitude and latitude information in the Json. How to calculate altitude information? 
    - nodes not having the altitude param shall be ignored.
2)	 What is the parameter for wifi strength? 
    - wifi strength param shall not be used.
3)	Any sample code we can get to know about the code standards followed in the university for these projects? 
    – gpl v3, java doc, andoid formatter
4) Creative Commons icons and flaticon.com for using the open source icons.

Non-functional requirements
1)	Code standards
2)	Exception handling
3)	Error logging with proper error codes.
4)	Manual Integration testing
